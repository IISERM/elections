Launch Speech - Gagan

It all began when I received Arvind sir's email saying I am a part of the election committee. That night I just couldnt sleep. I had this nightmare: 

	"I am sitting in a dark room and suddenly the door opens. Vijay Anand sir enters and gives me a box. The box is full of little chits of papers with names on it and also some tick marks. He said, 'Count these. More are coming.'"

This is when I woke up, sweating from head to toe. You see I just cant count. I can count till maybe 8 or so, at most I may be I can push this to 5. At this time, I went to the only person who I knew would understand my situation and can find a way of getting out of it. It was Atul.

He and I had been doing some crazy things along with a few more people (like Arjit) and I had faith that he would come up with something crazy to save me. He did. He went on and on about the perfect election system where the voters must be able to verify their own votes and also count them but somehow still no one must be able to trace the votes back to the voter who cast them. At 4 in the morning such a talk can kill you. At that moment I was convinced that he is about to kill me with this talk and therefore I wont have to count the ballots. I was on cloud nine!!

It turns out that his speech ended with 'therefore the only way I see is that the system has to be electronic!!'. He then pronounced that we must be a part of this 'Project NaveenTantra'. Let me invite him on stage to explain to you what this means and then take the mic back from him in case he starts the same lecture again!!

ATUL:

<!-- Naveen Tantra is basically a new democracy. The elections are the mechanism of initiating a new democracy and Naveen Tantra is a mechanism of conducting these elections.

Alright. So, as I told Gagan the other day, the ideal way of conducting elections is a system where I can see exactly where I cast my vote but noone else can. Also, I can see everyone else's votes without tracing them back to the person who cast the vote. This way I can also count the votes and verify that the actual winner won the elections.

<!-- THE POEM COMES HERE!! -->

GAGAN:

That was deep!! Reminded me of Master Yoda. Since when have you started speaking the first part of the sentence after the last??

ATUL:

Since we started making this NaveenTantra. Remember we made the last step first!!

GAGAN:

Yes, we voted before we even knew who we were voting for!! Lets show these people what to do to cast their votes!!
